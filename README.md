# ML-Models-From-Scratch

Welcome to the Machine Learning Models from Scratch repository! This project aims to provide a collection of Python code examples for building various machine learning models from scratch, without relying on popular machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn or TensorFlow. By understanding the fundamental algorithms and concepts behind these models, you can deepen your knowledge of machine learning and gain insights into how these models work under the hood.

## INTRODUCTION

Building machine learning models from scratch can be an enlightening experience that helps you grasp the core concepts of each algorithm. In this repository, we provide Python implementations for various machine learning models. This project is ideal for educational purposes, self-learning, and experimentation. By studying the code and playing around with the models, you can enhance your understanding of machine learning principles and improve your ability to design custom algorithms for specific tasks.Each model is implemented from scratch using Python and NumPy, ensuring that we keep the dependencies minimal.

## USAGE

Each machine learning model has its own Python script. To use a specific model, simply run the corresponding script.Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to gain a deeper understanding of how each algorithm functions. You can also use the models as a starting point for implementing your custom machine learning solutions.
